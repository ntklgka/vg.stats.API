# vgstats.xyz
This project is divided into three repos:

* vg.stats.tracker: https://github.com/ntklgka/vg.stats.tracker
* vg.stats.API: this one
* vg.stats.website: https://github.com/ntklgka/vg.stats.website


# vg.stats.API
The API for the data gathered by the vg.tracker and stored in the postgres db. Made using NodeJS/Express.
Currently only serving the most recent data and only vgstats.xyz is whitelisted. If the API could be useful to you let me know about what route you'd need.
